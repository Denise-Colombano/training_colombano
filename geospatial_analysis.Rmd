## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(sf)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(scales)
library(ggmap)
library(leaflet)
```

```{r}
## Read in shapefile using sf
ak_regions <- read_sf("shapefiles/ak_regions_simp.shp")

plot(ak_regions) # this coordinate system is not ideal for Alaska, which spans the int'l dateline; need a Pacific centered projection

class(ak_regions) # it's an sf dataframe, which works well with ggplot2

head(ak_regions)
```

# check coordinate system
```{r}
# look at crs - units, name, 4-digit code (EPSG code is an easy way to reference a projection)
st_crs(ak_regions) # crs = 4326

# transform it - We know it's in 4326 but want it in 3338
ak_regions_3338 <- ak_regions %>%
  st_transform(crs = 3338)

st_crs(ak_regions_3338)

# check new map - looks good!
plot(ak_regions_3338)
```

We will use several EPSG codes in this lesson. Here they are, along with their more readable names:

3338: Alaska Albers
4326: WGS84 (World Geodetic System 1984), used in GPS
3857: Pseudo-Mercator, used in Google Maps, OpenStreetMap, Bing, ArcGIS, ESRI

# see sf - tidyverse plays well together

Examples:
```{r}
ak_regions_3338 %>%
  select(region) # see there is still a geometry column

ak_regions_3338 %>%
  filter(region == "Southeast") # returns one row
```


# read in csv data for join
```{r}
pop <- read.csv("shapefiles/alaska_population.csv")

head(pop)
st_crs(pop) # there is no crs yet
```

# spatial join
```{r}
# coerce this dataframe into an sf object
# this crs 4326 is a good guess
?st_as_sf
pop_4326 <- st_as_sf(pop, 
                  coords = c('lng', 'lat'), # x,y
                  crs = 4326,
                  remove = F)

head(pop_4326)

# this won’t work right now because our coordinate reference systems are not the same
pop_joined <- st_join(pop_4326, ak_regions_3338, join = st_within)

# transform it first
pop_3338 <- st_transform(pop_4326, crs = 3338)

# try again
pop_joined <- st_join(pop_3338, ak_regions_3338, join = st_within)

head(pop_joined)
```

# question
Like we mentioned above, there are many different types of joins you can do with geospatial data. Examine the help page for these joins (?st_within will get you there). 

1) What other joins types might be appropriate for examining the relationship between points and polygyons? 
2) What about two sets of polygons?

st_within is a predicate function. others available that may/ may not make sense.

```{r}
# look at function
?st_within
```

Answers?
1) st_contains_properly, st_contains, st_covers, st_covered_by
2) st_intersects, st_touches, st_crosses, st_overlaps, st_equals


# analysis
Next we compute the total population for each region.
```{r}
# cool help page
?sf::tidyverse

# Geometries are sticky, use as.data.frame to let dplyr's own methods drop them
pop_region <- pop_joined %>% 
  as.data.frame() %>% # drop sf
  group_by(region) %>% 
  summarise(total_pop = sum(population))

head(pop_region)

# use regular left join, with region as key
pop_region_3338 <- left_join(ak_regions_3338, pop_region, by = "region")

#plot to check
plot(pop_region_3338["total_pop"])
```

```{r}
# this does a union on internal geometry boundaries
pop_mgmt_338 <- pop_region_3338 %>% 
  group_by(mgmt_area) %>% 
  summarize(total_pop = sum(total_pop))

plot(pop_mgmt_338["total_pop"])

# if you don't want to group geometries, specify do_union = F (default is T)
pop_mgmt_3338 <- pop_region_3338 %>% 
  group_by(mgmt_area) %>% 
  summarize(total_pop = sum(total_pop), do_union = F)

plot(pop_mgmt_3338["total_pop"])
```

```{r}
write_sf(pop_region_3338, "shapefiles/ak_regions_population.shp", delete_layer = TRUE)
```


# visualize with ggplot

## plot 1 - total pop
```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data=pop_region_3338, aes(fill = total_pop)) + # sf knows x,y
  theme_bw() +
  labs(fill = "Total Population") +
  # create a color gradient on the fly
  # labels = comma is from the scales package
  scale_fill_continuous(low = "khaki", high =  "firebrick", labels = comma) # comma is function from scales
```

## plot 2 - import rivers
```{r}
#The rivers shapefile
rivers_3338 <- read_sf("shapefiles/ak_rivers_simp.shp")
st_crs(rivers_3338) # always check crs

# Although no EPSG code is set explicitly, 
# with some sluething we can determine that this is EPSG:3338.
# copy/paste into Google to determine crs

ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = pop_region_3338, aes(fill = total_pop)) +
  geom_sf(data = rivers_3338, aes(size = StrOrder), color = "black") + # size= Stream Order
  scale_size(range = c(0.01, 0.2), guide = "none") + # scale the size of Stream Order
  theme_bw() +
  labs(fill = "Total Population") +
  scale_fill_continuous(low = "khaki", high =  "firebrick", labels = comma)
```

## plot 3 - add population
```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = pop_region_3338, aes(fill = total_pop)) +
  geom_sf(data = rivers_3338, aes(size = StrOrder), color = "black") + # size= Stream Order
  geom_sf(data = pop_3338, aes(), size = .5) +
  scale_size(range = c(0.01, 0.2), guide = "none") + # scale the size of Stream Order
  theme_bw() +
  labs(fill = "Total Population") +
  scale_fill_continuous(low = "khaki", high =  "firebrick", labels = comma)
```


# Incorporate base maps into static maps

We’ll need to transform our shapefile with population data by community to EPSG:3857 which is the CRS used for rendering maps in Google Maps, Stamen, and OpenStreetMap, among others.
```{r}
# transform crs
pop_3857 <- pop_3338 %>%
  st_transform(crs = 3857)

# Define a function to fix the bbox to be in EPSG:3857
# See https://github.com/dkahle/ggmap/issues/160#issuecomment-397055208
ggmap_bbox_to_3857 <- function(map) {
  if (!inherits(map, "ggmap")) stop("map must be a ggmap object")
  # Extract the bounding box (in lat/lon) from the ggmap to a numeric vector, 
  # and set the names to what sf::st_bbox expects:
  map_bbox <- setNames(unlist(attr(map, "bb")), 
                       c("ymin", "xmin", "ymax", "xmax"))
  
  # Coonvert the bbox to an sf polygon, transform it to 3857, 
  # and convert back to a bbox (convoluted, but it works)
  bbox_3857 <- st_bbox(st_transform(st_as_sfc(st_bbox(map_bbox, crs = 4326)), 3857))
  
  # Overwrite the bbox of the ggmap object with the transformed coordinates 
  attr(map, "bb")$ll.lat <- bbox_3857["ymin"]
  attr(map, "bb")$ll.lon <- bbox_3857["xmin"]
  attr(map, "bb")$ur.lat <- bbox_3857["ymax"]
  attr(map, "bb")$ur.lon <- bbox_3857["xmax"]
  map
}
```


```{r}
bbox <- c(-170, 52, -130, 64)   # This is roughly southern Alaska
ak_map <- get_stamenmap(bbox, zoom = 4) # ggmap function - zoom level 4 (resolution)
ak_map_3857 <- ggmap_bbox_to_3857(ak_map) # on the map object

ggmap(ak_map_3857) + 
  geom_sf(data = pop_3857, aes(color = population), inherit.aes = F) + # don't inherit ggmap aesthetics
  scale_color_continuous(low = "khaki", high =  "firebrick", labels = comma)
```

# Interactive maps with leaflet

Here we define a leaflet projection for Alaska Albers
```{r}
epsg3338 <- leaflet::leafletCRS(
  crsClass = "L.Proj.CRS",
  code = "EPSG:3338",
  proj4def =  "+proj=aea +lat_1=55 +lat_2=65 +lat_0=50 +lon_0=-154 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +ellps=GRS80 +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +units=m +no_defs",
  resolutions = 2^(16:7))

st_crs(pop_region_3338)

pop_region_4326 <- pop_region_3338 %>% st_transform(crs = 4326)

m <- leaflet(options = leafletOptions(crs = epsg3338)) %>%
        addPolygons(data = pop_region_4326, 
                    fillColor = "gray",
                    weight = 1)

m
```

## Format
We can add labels, legends, and a color scale.

```{r}
pal <- colorNumeric(palette = "Reds", domain = pop_region_4326$total_pop)

m2 <- leaflet(options = leafletOptions(crs = epsg3338)) %>%
        addPolygons(data = pop_region_4326, 
                    fillColor = ~pal(total_pop),
                    weight = 1,
                    color = "black",
                    fillOpacity = 1,
                    label = ~region) %>% 
        addLegend(position = "bottomleft",
                  pal = pal,
                  values = range(pop_region_4326$total_pop),
                  title = "Total Population")

m2
```


We can also add the individual communities, with popup labels showing their population, on top of that!
```{r}
pal <- colorNumeric(palette = "Reds", domain = pop_region_4326$total_pop)

m3 <- leaflet(options = leafletOptions(crs = epsg3338)) %>%
        addPolygons(data = pop_region_4326, 
                    fillColor = ~pal(total_pop),
                    weight = 1,
                    color = "black",
                    fillOpacity = 1) %>% 
        addCircleMarkers(data = pop_4326,
                         lat = ~lat,
                         lng = ~lng,
                         radius = ~log(population/500), # arbitrary scaling
                         fillColor = "gray",
                         fillOpacity = 1,
                         weight = 0.25,
                         color = "black",
                         label = ~paste0(pop_4326$city, ", population ", comma(pop_4326$population))) %>%
        addLegend(position = "bottomleft",
                  pal = pal,
                  values = range(pop_region_4326$total_pop),
                  title = "Total Population")

m3
```
